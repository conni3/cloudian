## Tips to Understand Verilog Code Faster

### ✅ 1. **Simulate mentally in time steps**

Ask yourself:

> "At the next rising clock edge, what changes?"

This helps you walk through how variables evolve over time.

---

### ✅ 2. **Track registers vs wires**

- `reg` = **stores** a value across time (needs a clock)
    
- `wire` = **combines** logic (no memory, instant update)
    

Focus on what variables **remember**, and what they **compute**.

---

### ✅ 3. **Highlight State Transitions**

- If the code uses `state` variables, mark where it changes.
    
- Make a state diagram if needed — even for simple ones.
    

---

### ✅ 4. **Look for reset behavior first**

- Understand what happens during a reset (`if (reset)`).
    
- This tells you the system’s **initial condition**.
    

---

### ✅ 5. **Recognize common patterns**

- This one is a **pulse generator or oscillator**.
    
- Other common patterns: shift registers, counters, FSMs.
    

Once you’ve seen a few of each, new code becomes very familiar.

### ✅ 6. **Ignore module ports at first**

When you’re just starting out, ignore all `input`/`output` declarations and look at the **always blocks** first — that's where the logic lives.
