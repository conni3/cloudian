As part of my internship, I decided to read "**Computer Organization and Design RISC-V edition" by David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy** by recommendation from my supervisor Sanka. 

I have written a series of articles as a reference for later to quickly remind myself of the ideas discussed and also, express my thoughts for the book.
