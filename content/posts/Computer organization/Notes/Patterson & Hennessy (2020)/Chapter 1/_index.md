This is the first chapter of the book. I divided my thoughts and summary into four sections:
- **Foundations & The Eight Great Ideas**  
    Covers the motivation behind studying computer architecture, the shift from uniprocessor to multicore systems, and introduces eight timeless design principles that shape computing systems—such as abstraction, pipelining, parallelism, and memory hierarchy.
    
- **Inside the Machine – Abstraction Layers & Technologies**  
    Explores the different levels below your program and explains the core technologies used to build modern processors and memory systems.
    
- **Performance, Power & the “Sea Change”**  
    Discusses how to evaluate computer performance using CPI, instruction count, and clock rate, introduces Amdahl’s Law, examines power constraints like the Power Wall, and explains why parallelism has become central in modern architecture.
    
- **Real-World Examples & Wrap-Up**  
    Applies concepts from earlier sections to benchmark analysis (e.g., Intel Core i7), outlines common fallacies and pitfalls, and introduces the five classic components of a computer as a framework for the rest of the book.

There is also history and exercise sections in the chapter. I might be updating in the future in my free time.
