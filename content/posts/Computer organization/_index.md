Here, I will be updating what I learned about computer organization and architecture. The two textbooks I am learning from are *Digital Design and Computer Architecture - RISC-V Edition by Sarah L. Harris and David Harris* and *Computer Organization and Design - The Hardware/Software Interface: RISC-V Edition by David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy*.
