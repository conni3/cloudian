    - Installed via package manager; ran `verilator --version` to confirm toolchain.
        
- **SV Fundamentals â€“ Ports**
    
    - Reviewed `input`/`output`/`inout` declarations, named vs. ordered port lists, and port-type semantics.
        

#### ðŸ“… Tuesday, June 17

- **Docs 03 & 04**
    
    - Drafted **Coding Conventions** and **Packages & Interfaces** sections.
        
- **Installed Icarus**
    
    - Installed `iverilog`; verified v11.0.0 via `iverilog --version`.
        
- **SV Fundamentals â€“ Nets vs. Variables**
    
    - Studied `wire` vs. `logic/reg`, implicit nets, driver resolution and multiple-driver rules.
        

#### ðŸ“… Wednesday, June 18

- **Docs 05 & 06**
    
    - Wrote **CI & Testing** and **Automation & Optimization** chapters.
        
- **Dockerized Vivado Setup**
    
    - Created Dockerfile for Vivado 2024.2; built container and ran a simple synthesis smoke test.
        
- **SV Fundamentals â€“ Tasks vs. Functions**
    
    - Compared syntax, side-effects, timing control; wrote examples to illustrate use cases.
        

#### ðŸ“… Thursday, June 19

- **Doc 07**
    
    - Finalized **Contributing & Versioning**, outlined future cache/MMU work and internship context.

### 3. Key Learnings

- **Modular Documentation Workflow**  
    Dividing the seven docs across days ensured steady progress and consistent style.
    
- **Early CI Integration**  
    Scaffolding scripts and tool installs in CI guarantee reproducible builds and tests.
    
- **Containerized FPGA Toolchain**  
    Dockerizing Vivado simplifies environment setup for all team members.
    
- **SV Fundamentals Mastery**  
    Deepened understanding of port semantics, net/variable distinctions, and procedural constructs.
