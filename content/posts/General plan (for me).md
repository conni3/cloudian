**Processor Development 6-Week Plan**

**Day 1–2: Define Your Goals & Constraints**

- Identify your target application (embedded, teaching, HPC)
    
- Choose ISA style (RISC vs. CISC), datapath width (32‑bit/64‑bit)
    
- Set performance, area, power budgets and decide on FPGA vs. ASIC prototyping
    

**Day 3–4: Brush Up on Digital Logic Foundations**

- Review combinational blocks (ALU, MUX, adders) and sequential elements (D‑FF, registers)
    
- Study timing concepts: setup/hold times, clock domains, synchronous design
    

**Day 5–7: Choose Your Toolchain & Workflow**

- Select an HDL (Verilog/VHDL) and install simulator (e.g., Icarus Verilog, GTKWave)
    
- Set up synthesis tool (Yosys/Vivado) and version control (Git)
    
- Create project structure (rtl/, tb/, asm/, docs/)
    

**Day 8–10: Specify Your ISA**

- Define register file depth, instruction formats, addressing modes
    
- Draft a minimal instruction set: loads, stores, arithmetic ops, branches
    
- Write sample assembly snippets (e.g., loop, array sum)
    

**Day 11–13: Build & Verify the ALU in HDL**

- Implement ADD, SUB, AND, OR, SHIFT operations
    
- Develop a testbench to exercise all functions and flags (overflow, zero)
    
- Simulate edge cases and verify correctness
    

**Day 14–16: Design the Register File**

- Implement multi‑ported register file (2 reads, 1 write)
    
- Test simultaneous read/write behavior and reset
    
- Address pipeline hazards if future pipelining is planned
    

**Day 17–19: Create the Datapath Skeleton**

- Integrate ALU, register file, and program counter
    
- Hook up instruction memory interface for fetch stage
    
- Build a simple FSM for fetch–decode–execute
    

**Day 20–22: Implement the Control Unit**

- Design a hardwired FSM or microcode ROM for control signals per opcode
    
- Simulate complete instructions through datapath
    
- Add flags handling and branching logic
    

**Day 23–24: Write a Simple Assembler & Test Programs**

- Create a script or small program to translate mnemonics to opcodes
    
- Load a test program into instruction ROM and run in simulation
    
- Debug control flow and data path issues
    

**Day 25–27: Iterate: Add Features & Pipeline**

- Extend ISA (multiply, divide, bit‑manipulation)
    
- Insert pipeline stages (IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB)
    
- Implement hazard detection, forwarding, and stalling
    

**Day 28–30: Prototype on FPGA**

- Choose an FPGA development board:
    
    - **Xilinx Artix-7** (e.g., Digilent Nexys A7) for mid-range performance, ample logic slices, and BRAM.
        
    - **Intel Cyclone V** (e.g., Terasic DE10‑Lite) as a cost‑effective option with decent resources.
        
    - **Lattice iCE40** (e.g., iCEBreaker) for low‑power applications and open‑source toolchain support.
        
- Synthesize your RTL and generate a bitstream for the selected board.
    
- Implement a UART or BRAM loader to upload programs at runtime.
    
- Verify basic I/O functionality (LED blink, serial “Hello” output).
    

**Day 31–33:**–33: Profile & Optimize**

- Measure resource usage (LUTs, FFs, BRAMs) and max clock frequency
    
- Identify critical paths, retime registers, balance pipeline stages
    
- Consider simple cache or branch prediction for performance boost
    

**Day 34–36: (Optional) Prepare for ASIC**

- Clean up RTL for synthesis, add DFT hooks (scan chains)
    
- Engage with an open MPW shuttle program for tape‑out
    
- Perform place & route and timing sign‑off
