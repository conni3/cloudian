# Internship timeline

### Motivation for the internship:

In the long term future, I really want to become a researcher in the future. It might come from trying to be enough or even feel better. But I really do want to become someone I can be proud of and someone who grows everyday. 

This might be a bit of a rocky road and I keep hearing that from a lot of people and sometimes I get scared, but there are also people who support me. So I am willing to give it a try.

Back to the topic of this internship specifically, the main goal is that I build a processor.
