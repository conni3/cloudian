      <description>Preface # The preface starts with a motivation to read this book - professionals of every computing specialty should understand both hardware and software. This point was emphasized when the authors mentioned the switch from uniprocessor to multicore microprocessors (which will be emphasized many more times throughout Chapter 1).</description>

      <description>Below Your Program # For computers to run complex applications, there needs to be some sort of translation. Computers can only run simple operations; if we were to write the program for example for this website (although a simple application) - we need so much effort and time.</description>

      <title>Chapter 1 - Computer Abstractions and Technology</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/computer-organization/notes/patterson--hennessy-2020/chapter-1/</link>

      <description>This is the first chapter of the book. I divided my thoughts and summary into four sections:
Foundations &amp;amp; The Eight Great Ideas
Covers the motivation behind studying computer architecture, the shift from uniprocessor to multicore systems, and introduces eight timeless design principles that shape computing systems—such as abstraction, pipelining, parallelism, and memory hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Computer Organization and Design RISC-V edition</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/computer-organization/notes/patterson--hennessy-2020/</link>

      <description>As part of my internship, I decided to read &amp;ldquo;Computer Organization and Design RISC-V edition&amp;rdquo; by David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy by recommendation from my supervisor Sanka.
I have written a series of articles as a reference for later to quickly remind myself of the ideas discussed and also, express my thoughts for the book.</description>
